        <div class="article-body">
          <p>In the City of Peace sat two towering structures. The first was the palace of the great king and the second was the temple to the One God. </p>
          <p>The palace was surrounded by three great walls that circled round about it. Each wall was made of thick hewn limestone. Each block was hand carved by skilled masons, each conscripted to serve the king with only a single plate of food a day. The slave markets of the neighboring nations were emptied to provide labor to lift each block into place. </p>
          <p>Between each wall, deep trenches were dug with plows pulled by great oxen imported from wealthy neighbors. The levies on the people of the nation was great, but the king’s word was final, and he was the mouthpiece of the One God.</p>
          <p>Inside the innermost wall was a grand courtyard with a beautiful garden. Plants had been imported from the furthest ends of the earth. Green leafy plants and fruit bearing plants alike. Each day the king would roam the gardens. Assigning to each shrub and plant a new name. The garden was tended by a refugee family who had escaped the war in the southlands. From morning till night they cared for each plant. Their pay was meager, not enough to live in a crafted home, rather living in a leather tent in the wilderness outside the City walls. </p>
          <p>The main building of the palace was beautiful. The palace had a combination of steeped roofs, in the style of the northern architects, and flat roofs, in the style native to the City. Amidst the palace were five towers each capped with a gleaming white gold obelisk. When the sun began to set the three western towers shone with dazzling light, blinding sailors on the great western sea. </p>
          <p>At the base of each tower was a library filled with the knowledge and wisdom of the known world. When the libraries were established, the king sent his swiftest messengers to the great halls of knowledge and wisdom across the face of the earth. The kings and princes of these nations sent the books on the backs of their most able-bodied slaves, a gift of knowledge and gift of bodies. </p>
          <p>The king’s hall was the breadth of 500 spearmen and the length of two mature sea dragons laid tail to snout. From the doors of the hall to the base of the throne was a carpet sewn by the finest carpet makers of the north. Each length of material cost 300 days wages. There were 15 lengths in total. </p>
          <p>High above the marble floors of the hall seven were exquisitely crafted stained glass windows. Each window depicted one of the Seven Mighty Deeds of the king. </p>
          <p>The windows were set in place by giants from the south each purchased from southern merchants for 30 days wages. When all the work had been done, each giant was conscripted to serve in the king’s army and were given their choice of the people flock and cattle. </p>
          <p>One day, Arkok, who was numbered among the giants, was roaming the countryside and came upon two young children playing in the field. Now Arkok was short of sight and he knew that he was given leave to eat of any beast of the field. So he took each child in his hands and ate them. Only their bones and their playthings he left. </p>
          <p>When the family told the king of the things that had happened, he was outraged. He ordered the mother and father be flogged severely, once for leaving their children to the slaughter and once for accusing the king of injustice. </p>
          <p>All these things the king said he did according to the word of the One God. </p>
          <p>At the heart of the temple of the One God was a chamber. In the chamber, set between two winged figures crafted of hammered bronze, sat the God Box. The God Box was something of the king’s invention. In it the One God was said to rest. Day and night he was available to the king for council and direction. Through the king, the people of the nation could seek to hear from their god. Twice a year the God Box was brought ought from the chamber and place on a special altar at the top of the stairs to the temple. </p>
          <p>At the king’s command the Box would begin to shake and smoke would pour from its top. Dazzling lights would emanate from within the box, and all the people were able to experience their god, and they would worship. </p>
          <p>When the ritual was ended, the God Box would be carried back to its chamber, and there it would rest for another six months. </p>
          <p>Now it came about that in the month of the mid year festival of the God Box that Hazaq, a priest in training, met the One God. </p>
          <p>On the outskirts of the city there was a small village with a historic well. As part of his daily practice, Hazaq went daily to the well to drink and on his way he would meditate on the words from the ancient teachings of the One God. </p>
          <p>With each step he would breathe out, speaking the words of the One God’s teaching. With each breath, he would ask for wisdom to understand the words he spoke. </p>
          <p>On the fifth day of fourth month when Hazaq was making his daily trip to the well he was greeted with by a great lion on the road. </p>
          <p>The lion was larger than any lion Hazaq had ever heard of. It’s paws were twice the size of a normal lion’s and it’s teeth were like an elephants tusks. Its eyes were like lightning, unbearable to behold, and yet impossible to look away from. On its back were two great pairs of wings. Shaped liked those of a giant eagle, but colored like the lion’s golden mane. </p>
          <p>The lion stood his ground and his eyes would not leave Hazaq. Hazaq fell to the ground, terrified. </p>
          <p>“My lord,” Hazaq said. “May it please you to let me pass. I am. Hit a simple man on his way to fetch water. I do not wish you any harm.”</p>
          <p>“Son of man,” the lion said, “you could not harm me if you had the might of seventy giants.”</p>
          <p>At the voice of the lion, which was more like thunder and the felling of trees than the voice of a man, Hazaq trembled. He immediately lay himself prostrate, knowing he was in the presence of something great.</p>
          <p>“Son of man, rise and face me, for this day you shall see God.”</p>
          <p>With trembling hands and fleeting courage, Hazaq stood himself up, but did not lift his face to the lion. </p>
          <p>“Look at me,” came a much gentler voice. Now more like a trickling brook than a roll of thunder. </p>
          <p>Hazaq gazed into the eyes of the lion and saw everything he had ever done. Righteous and shameful things a like. He knew now that he was looking at the Holy One, and as no man could see the face of God and live, he once again fell prostrate before him. </p>
          <p>The lion laughed a good laugh. The kind of laugh a grandfather laughs when his grand child gives him a handmade gift. </p>
          <p>“My son,” the voice of the lion came again, gentler than any soft voice Hazaq had ever heard. Barely a whisper and yet louder than a windstorm. “I have seen the oppression of my people. The whips of the king of my people are daily at their backs. Day and night the poor among you are barred from the city, they pound at the gates and their voices are not heard. Joining their mournful chorus are those fleeing the wars in the south. The king does not open his gates though I have given him riches in abundance.</p>
          <p>“Even what I have not given him he has stolen and so his wealth grows. He robs the needy and gives treasures to the powerful. And all the while, he does so in my name.”</p>
          <p>The sky seemed to darken and it seemed to Hazaq that the lion grew larger with each word. </p>
          <p>“Daily I look on the king’s worship with contempt. The priests of his temple are a stain on my people. They do not comfort the lowly or give food to the needy. Once a day I come in disguise to the temple for food. And once a day I am turned away hungry. </p>
          <p>Twice a year the king of my people brings out a box and dances around it. This detestable invention is designed only to cheat and swindle my people. Thief! Charlatan! Who told you that God could live in a box. Is it not written, ‘God does not dwell in a house of cedar?’</p>
          <p>And yet the king of your people extends his boarders at the mention of my name.”</p>
          <p>Hazaq trembled, fearing to speak but fearing not to speak. When he was sure that he would not interrupt the great lion, he spoke. </p>
          <p>“My lord,” Hazaq answered, “we are an unclean people, simple in all we do and say. How could we fathom the mysteries of the cosmos and give voice to your inner thoughts. We have erred in what we do, and have not kept your good commands. Yet what can my people, who enjoy the gift of your goodness and our nation, do in the face of such evil.”</p>
          <p>“Serve me, not a box. The voice of the king is not your authority. I am you king and your God. As much as it serves peace, do as he says, but when the lowly are harmed, the refugee turned away destitute, and my people enslaved, then you must not obey him or follow in the way of his precepts. </p>
          <p>Speak in the hall of your king. Tell him I am about to become unboxed. And I will be with you. Till the end of the age.”</p>

            <li><a href="https://svspress.com/on-marriage-and-family-life-st-john-chrysostom/"><em>On Marriage and Family Life</em></a> by St. John Chrysostom
              Yep, still working through this one. But I’m still loving it. Looking to wrap it up early this week.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mean-Dont-Have-Tithe-Deconstruction/dp/1606084054"><em>You Mean I Dont Have to Tithe?: A Deconstruction of Tithing and a Reconstruction of Post-Tithe Giving</em></a> by David A. Croteau
              This is an excellent breakdown of historic Christian thought on tithing from the Apostolic Fathers all the way through the tithing renewal movement in the late 1800’s. I’m still working through it, but the author’s thrust thus far has been that tithing is not a command applied to Christians nor are the promises associated with it (such as Micah 3). Ultimately Jesus’ command of radical generosity, even to the point of giving all you own (Luke 21:1-4, Mark 10:17-22, Acts 4:32-36). I have not perfectly landed on my approach to this topic, as I need to spend more time in it, however this has affected the way my wife and I plan to give going forward.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Public Reading</strong>: Each week I meet with a group of guys to read through Scripture aloud. This week we completed the book of Job and began the book of Psalms. There is nothing like hearing God’s admonish of Job read aloud. I guarantee you’ll get goosebumps.</p>
          <h2 id="on-the-calendar">On the Calendar</h2>
          <p>This Sunday is the first Sunday after Epiphany and the day when we recall Jesus’s baptism. There’s a lot we can unpack about the nature of Christ’s baptism and its implications for us today. But for now, let’s recall to mind that when Jesus rose out of the water, God the Father revealed Christ to be His Son. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Eternal Father, at the baptism of Jesus you revealed him to be your Son, and your Holy Spirit descended upon him like a dove: Grant that we, who are born again by water and the Spirit, may be faithful as your adopted children; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  <strong>Amen.</strong> </p>
